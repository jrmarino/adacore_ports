GNATdoc is a documentation tool for Ada which processes source files,
extracts documentation directly from the sources, and generates
annotated HTML files. It is based on the source cross-reference information
(e.g. generated by GNAT for Ada files). This means that you should ensure
that cross-reference information has been generated before generating the
documentation. It also relies on standard comments that it extracts from
the source code. The engine in charge of extracting them coupled with the
cross-reference engine gives GNATdoc all the flexibility needed to generate
accurate documentation, and report errors in case of wrong documentation.

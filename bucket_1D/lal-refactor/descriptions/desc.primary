LAL Refactor
This repository provides a collection of source code refactoring tools for
the Ada programming language, leveraging the power of Libadalang. These
tools aim to automate and assist with common code refactoring tasks,
improving code maintainability and reducing the risk of introducing errors
during the refactoring process.

Currently, the main user of these tools is the Ada Language Server.

This project is a port of the Prettier formatter to the Ada programming
language. The aim of this project is to provide a tool that allows Ada
programmers to create formatters for any language of their choosing.

Please note that only the core generic formatting algorithm and its
dependencies were ported. The formatters for all supported languages are
not included in this project.
